Changes:

Boss2 spawns in where the player is standing and follows them around the map.

Every 5 seconds one of 5 events occur, WHILE THE BOSS IS STILL ALIVE, including:
1.The player's health is halved
2.The player's health is doubled
3.The Boss fires it's machine gun
4.The Boss fires it's missles
5.The Boss spawns a mutant

The boss has unlimited health, the only way to kill the boss is by killing most of the enemies in level, which will trigger the boss's death.

Killing a enemy causes the next event to happen two seconds later, this effect stacks.
